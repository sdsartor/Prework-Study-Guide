## Description

- My motivation for this project was to learn to code and use Git properly.
- I build this project, because I needed a practice template to work on my coding.
- This project solves the issue studying code by making it easier to manage your notes.
- I learned that Git bash is much more complex to set up without proper guidance, but also learned how to apply three coding languages into one application.
